Drug  development  is  becoming  longer  and  more  costly.  This  is  spurringpharmaceutical companies to investigate how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used toimprove  efficiencies.  AI  methods  have  now  found  applications  in  every  stage  of  thedrug discovery pipeline. One area in which they have been particularly impactful is denovo drug design (DNDD); the process of using computers to design and generate largenumbers of candidate drugs. A wide variety of DNDD models that combine deep neuralnetworks  with  reinforcement  learning  have  been  developed.  Several  of  these  modelshave found practical applications, although they remain to become widely adopted byindustry. Key challenges include the difficulty in removing dataset biases, a lack of modelexplainability, and a lack of regulatory approval that is limiting uptake rates. In this articlewe address the most influential AI algorithms in de novo drug discovery, what challengesremain for these models, and how these challenges could be overcome.
